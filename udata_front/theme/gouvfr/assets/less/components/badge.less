Merriam-Webster defines a badge as an emblem awarded for a particular accomplishment.
Since we consider moderating and publishing data on this website an amazing feat, we decided to award badges for all the people involved.
Additionally, it also allows regular-non-awarded people to quickly identify public servants and administrators.
