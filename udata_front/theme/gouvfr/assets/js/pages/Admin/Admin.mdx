# Admin

The administration is a beta page in WIP status to port the old udata admin to udata-front.

## How to use ?

The administration is a separate entry file. It is included in the `beta/admin` template.

## Contributing

You should start your development of a new page in the `pages/Admin` folder by creating a subfolder.
Work on your page and add relevant stories and interactions.
Use `msw` parameters to catch requests before they are sent to mock the responses.
