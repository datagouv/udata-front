# Welcome to data.gouv.fr theme

gouvfr is the udata_front theme for data.gouv.fr.

It uses DSFR for styling.
It's made of Vue 3 files with Composition API + Typescript, and some pre-existing components made with Option API and / or Javascript.

Some components aren't typed yet and include types errors.
The goal is to move all components to Composition API + Typescript and correct all type errors.

## How to use Storybook ?

All components have a documentation with a small description about their usage and how to use them.

Inside the sidebar, below each documentation, you can find stories for the selected component.
Sometimes, you can also find subcomponents documented.
If they aren't mean to be use on their own, they are presented in a `Internals` folder.
