# Welcome to data.gouv.fr theme

gouvfr is the udata_front theme for data.gouv.fr.

It uses DSFR for styling.
It's made of Vue 3 files with Composition API, and some pre-existing components made with Option API.

It uses [TypeScript in JS via JSDoc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html#providing-type-hints-in-js-via-jsdoc) to ease the learning curve for new developers.
Some components aren't typed yet and include types errors.
The goal is to move all components to Composition API and correct all type errors.
