# Toggletip

A toggletip is a tooltip that is activated on click and not on hover / focus.
This allows a better UX for users with touch screens, screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## Accessibility

The component is based on the [disclosure pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/).

It contains a button with the attributes :
- `aria-expanded` to indicate if the toggletip is shown
- `aria-controls` to link to the toggletip

The toggletip is placed directly after the button in the tab sequence so that it works with assistive technologies that doesn't handle `aria-controls`.

The toggletip is shown on click only and it's hidden :
- on focus out of the button or toggletip
- on esc keypress
- on click outside the toggletip

Another way of implemented a toggletip is with a [live region feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions).

The disclosure pattern was chosen because it allows the toggletip content to be already present on page but hidden for all type of users.
