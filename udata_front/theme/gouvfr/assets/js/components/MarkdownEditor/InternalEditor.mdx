# Internal Editor

This is where we defined all our logic and interface.

## Architecture overview

The `<MarkdownEditor>` is simply a component that wraps this one in different required providers.

We use `@milkdown` to make most of the work about markdown and convertion between markdown and prosemirror.
We also use `@prosemirror-adapter/vue` to allow us to mount Vue components when we add plugins to prosemirror.

Finally, we use various milkdown plugins to provide basic markdown functionalities.

The top menu interface is coded in the `<InternalEditor>`.
The commands called when a user presses a button is coming from ready-made plugins or custom ones.

The custom plugins are located in the `Milkdown` folder.
The `Prosemirror` folder contains prosemirror-only logic, extracted from our milkdown plugins.

## Breakdown of each custom plugin

### dsfrColumnResizingPlugin

We want to display DSFR styled tables in our markdown content.

To do this, we had to use a custom plugin to follow the DSFR mark-up and wrap the `<table>` element in a `<div>`.
Doing so, the DSFR js script mutates some attributes of the table and its children.
We had to exclude these to prosemirror mutation changes to avoid a conflict between both changes detection.

All this custom logic is tailored to prosemirror so it's located in `ProseMirror/DSFRTableView.ts`.
There is only a simple plugin wrapper in `Milkdown/dsfrColumnResizingPlugin.ts`.

### LinkEdit

We want to assist user to add links to the editor so they don't have to type markdown syntax.
To do this, we show a tooltip to the user allowing them to paste their link.

This plugin contains 5 files :
- `index.ts` exports the other files.
- `configureEditTooltip.ts` makes the link between the LinkEditTooltip component and Milkdown.
- `LinkEditTooltip.ts` creates mildown contexts and an instance of the milkdown tooltip plugin.
- `LinkEditTooltip.vue` is the component shown inside the milkdown tooltip. It's mounted once when the editor launch.
- `inserLink.ts` is the command that show the tooltip.

### LinkPreview

We want to assist user to edit existing links in the editor.
To do this, we show a tooltip to the user allowing them to edit or remove their link.

This plugin contains 6 files :
- `index.ts` exports the other files.
- `configurePreviewTooltip.ts` makes the link between the LinkPreviewTooltip component and Milkdown.
- `LinkPreviewTooltip.ts` creates mildown contexts and an instance of the milkdown tooltip plugin.
- `LinkPreviewTooltip.vue` is the component shown inside the milkdown tooltip. It's mounted once when the editor launch.
- `shouldShowPreview.ts` is the internal logic to know if the preview tooltip should be displayed or not.
- `useLinkPreview.ts` is a composable to keep track of the current link to preview. This is done to allow vue to watch it and trigger changes.

The `configurePreviewTooltip` adds DOM event listeners to prosemirror. It allows us to check if the user is hovering a link.

### TableSelector

We want to allow a user to manage rows and columns after adding a table.
To do this, we show decorations around the left and top cells.
A user can click on them to show tooltips or drag them to reorder them.

This plugin contains 2 files :
- `tableSelectorPlugin` creates a new milkdown plugin and add decorations around the selected table.
- `TableSelectorWidget.vue` is the vue component displayed as decoration.

Note : decoration is the prosemirror term to DOM elements that aren't part of the document.

### TableTooltip

When a user clicks on a table selector, we want to show them with abilities to :
- add row / column before
- delete the current row / column
- add row / column after
- change the column alignment

To do this, there is a tooltip responsible for showing the correct buttons based on the table selector clicked.
